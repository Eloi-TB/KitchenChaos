# Kitchen Chaos Extended Version

## Introduction

Welcome to the extended and enhanced version of Kitchen Chaos, a project inspired by Code Monkey's comprehensive courses on game development using Unity. This repository not only follows the guided project from the initial singleplayer to the complex multiplayer implementation but also integrates personal improvements and additional features to elevate the game experience.

## About the Courses

### Part 1: [Singleplayer Course](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg?si=H1UOf59B_PQL7iVD)

The journey begins with the singleplayer course, where the foundational elements of the game were established. Here, the focus was on Unity's core mechanics, game logic, and clean code practices. The course provided a solid base, from which this project has been extended.

### Part 2: [Multiplayer Complete Course](https://youtu.be/7glCsF9fv3s?si=JPSki893n3EI9UNg)

Building upon the singleplayer version, the multiplayer course delves into Unity's official multiplayer solution, Netcode for GameObjects. It covers crucial multiplayer concepts such as data synchronization, server vs. client authority, RPCs, NetworkVariables, and much more. The course transitions the project into a fully functional multiplayer game.

## Personal Enhancements

While the initial project laid the groundwork, I've taken the liberty to add my own code improvements and gameplay features.
